# Template for creating an RMarkdown website

This contains a base set of files you need for making an RMarkdown website.

* Make sure the .Rmd file in the main directory of the project is named index.Rmd. 

* The other .Rmd files can have any name you'd like and need to be in the folder called `content` in the main directory. 

* The `_site` folder and `_site.yml` file need to be named exactly as they are. The `_site` folder is initially empty, but once you build the site, it will be populated.

* Link to the files in the `content` directory in the the content.Rmd file.
